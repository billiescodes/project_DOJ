** status_type = booked ** is the harshest punishment, it implies the arrested person is taken to the police station, fingerprinted, booked, and detained in jail, while "cited" means the person is released

+ Black juveniles make up about 21% of all arrests in 2013, however  ~ 27% of all booked cases 
+ In contrast White juveniles make up only 19% of all arrests, and only ~ 17% are booked


Plot 1: 
![alt text] (https://github.com/billiescodes/project_DOJ/blob/master/plot1-2_Raw_PercentStatType.png)
+ More than 50% of all Black Juveniles are booked when in Police Custody; It's the only group that has a higher rate of bookings than citations 
+ Hispanic Juveniles are being cited slightly more often (41% of the time) than being booked (40%)
+ Asian Juveniles are by far the least likely to be booked (28% of the time), and are cited about as often as white juvies (48% and 49% respecitvely).
+ Asian and 'Other' ethnic groups are most likely to be just cited while in Police Custody

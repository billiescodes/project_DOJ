** status_type = booked ** is the harshest punishment, it implies the arrested person is taken to the police station, fingerprinted, booked, and detained in jail, while "cited" means the person is released

+ Black juveniles make up about 21% of all arrests in 2013, however  ~ 27% of all booked cases 
+ In contrast White juveniles make up only 19% of all arrests, and only ~ 17% are booked
